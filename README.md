 Programming Assignment
Hi!

You are one of our JavaScript developers and I need to put you on the following assignment.
We have received an assignment from “FindYourLove “who want a website where users can see profiles of people to find love (A dating site). For this assignment, you only need to think about functionality and not design, we will arrange that later!

This is the functionality that I need you to encode in the HTML files in the attached folder:
(There is 3 files)

- all-profiles.html: View all profiles
    • On this page you must display all the profiles. I have attached 6 pictures of users to use. Have the information about them in arrays and use a for-loop to print all the profiles on the website. I would like to see the name, photo, age and short description on each profile.

- profile-suggestions.html: Here the user should get 1 out of 4 profiles after entering age and man or woman. Use if-else to check what user enters and view a profile. With age you should check if what the user has entered is greater than or equal to 25.

- optional-functionality.html: FindYourLove says they would like to see a suggestion for a page with some fun and exciting functionality they can use. In this exercise, you can define what will happen on the page and what techniques you want to use.

The boss
